# linux_survival_guide
Using this repo has a place to keep random notes, potential issues, and tips and tricks to keep track of while I navigate working in linux for the first time in many years. 

This repo is inspired by Steven Pestana's `how-to-graduate` repo, which has helped so many people. Thank you Steven!
